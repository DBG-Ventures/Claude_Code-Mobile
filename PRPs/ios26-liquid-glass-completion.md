description: |

---

## Goal

**Feature Goal**: Complete the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design system implementation for the VisionForge SwiftUI client, including accessibility compliance, device compatibility, performance optimization, and comprehensive testing to achieve production readiness.

**Deliverable**: Production-ready iOS 26 Liquid Glass effects system integrated into existing VisionForge SwiftUI client with comprehensive test coverage, accessibility compliance, performance monitoring, and App Store deployment preparation.

**Success Definition**: VisionForge app maintains 60fps performance during liquid glass interactions, respects accessibility settings (reduceTransparency/reduceMotion), gracefully degrades on older devices (iPhone XR+), maintains <20% additional battery usage, passes App Store review requirements, and demonstrates liquid fluidity in user interactions.

## User Persona

**Target User**: Claude Code CLI Power Users extending workflows to mobile devices

**Use Case**: Enhanced mobile Claude Code experience with premium iOS 26 Liquid Glass visual effects that provide tactile feedback, improved spatial awareness, and professional aesthetic while maintaining full accessibility and performance standards.

**User Journey**:
1. Launch VisionForge app and experience liquid glass startup animations
2. Navigate sessions with flowing liquid selection states and depth effects
3. Send messages with pressure-responsive liquid bubble interactions
4. Experience real-time streaming with liquid flow effects that enhance readability
5. Switch between sessions with smooth liquid transitions and context preservation
6. Adjust accessibility settings and see graceful fallback to solid interfaces when needed

**Pain Points Addressed**:
- Static UI feels dated compared to iOS 26 design standards
- Lack of tactile feedback reduces engagement with mobile Claude Code interactions
- No visual differentiation from generic chat applications
- Missing accessibility compliance prevents users with motion sensitivity from using the app

## Why

- **iOS 26 Design Leadership**: Liquid Glass represents Apple's premium design direction, essential for professional mobile applications
- **User Engagement Enhancement**: Tactile liquid interactions increase user satisfaction and time spent in mobile Claude Code workflows
- **Accessibility Compliance Mandate**: App Store requirements and inclusive design principles require reduceTransparency/reduceMotion support
- **Competitive Differentiation**: Premium visual effects distinguish VisionForge from generic AI chat clients
- **Platform Integration**: Native iOS 26 effects demonstrate deep platform integration and technical sophistication
- **Performance Excellence**: Proper implementation showcases advanced mobile development capabilities with GPU optimization

## What

Complete the iOS 26 Liquid Glass implementation by building upon existing placeholder components to create a production-ready effects system:

1. **Core Liquid Animation System**: Implement iOS 26 spring animation curves optimized for liquid interactions with performance monitoring
2. **Official API Integration**: Replace placeholder effects with official .liquidGlass(), .depthLayer(), .adaptiveTint() SwiftUI modifiers
3. **Device Capability Detection**: Implement automatic device detection with graceful degradation (iPhone 12+ full effects, iPhone XR+ basic effects)
4. **Accessibility Compliance System**: Mandatory support for reduceTransparency, reduceMotion, Dynamic Type, and VoiceOver compatibility
5. **Component Enhancement**: Upgrade existing MessageBubble, ConversationView, and SessionSidebarView with liquid interactions
6. **Performance Optimization**: Battery monitoring, frame rate tracking, memory management, and GPU optimization
7. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, accessibility tests, performance validation, and device compatibility verification
8. **Production Readiness**: App Store compliance, error handling, user feedback systems, and deployment preparation

### Known Gotchas of our codebase & Library Quirks

```swift
// CRITICAL: iOS 26 Liquid Glass API patterns
// Official Apple APIs must be used exclusively for App Store compliance
// Custom liquid implementations may be rejected
import SwiftUI

// CORRECT: Official iOS 26 Liquid Glass usage
struct LiquidGlassView: View {
    @Environment(\.accessibilityReduceTransparency) var reduceTransparency
    @Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            content
        }
        .glassEffect(reduceTransparency ? .clear : .regular)
        .animation(reduceMotion ? .none : .liquidResponse, value: someState)
    }
}

// CRITICAL: Device capability detection - iPhone 12+ for optimal performance
// Glass effects require significant GPU resources
func checkDeviceCapabilities() -> Bool {
    // iPhone 12 and newer for full Liquid Glass (A14 Bionic+)
    return ProcessInfo.processInfo.processorCount >= 6
}

// GOTCHA: Glass effects cannot sample other glass elements
// Wrong: Nested glass effects
VStack {
    Text("Item 1").glassEffect()  // ❌ This won't work inside GlassEffectContainer
    Text("Item 2").glassEffect()  // ❌ Glass elements can't sample each other
}.glassEffect()

// Correct: Use GlassEffectContainer for coordination
GlassEffectContainer {
    VStack {
        Text("Item 1")  // ✅ Content inside container
        Text("Item 2")  // ✅ Effects applied at container level
    }
}

// CRITICAL: Accessibility environment detection is MANDATORY
// App Store rejection likely without proper accessibility support
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceTransparency) var reduceTransparency
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion
@Environment(\.dynamicTypeSize) var dynamicTypeSize

// GOTCHA: SessionStateManager integration preservation
// Existing functionality must be preserved during liquid glass enhancement
// Current implementation: 648 lines with sophisticated session caching
// Pattern: Do not modify existing session management logic

// CRITICAL: Real-time streaming performance preservation
// StreamingTextView uses AttributedString for optimal performance
// Pattern: Maintain existing streaming optimization during liquid enhancement
@State private var visibleText = AttributedString()
// Avoid: withAnimation for typewriter effects - causes performance issues

// GOTCHA: VisionForge project uses CoreData (not SwiftData) for production stability
// Pattern: Maintain CoreData persistence patterns in SessionPersistenceService
// Reason: SwiftData has stability issues identified in research

// CRITICAL: Battery monitoring implementation required
// iOS 26 Liquid Glass can impact battery life significantly
// Pattern: Monitor GPU usage and provide user feedback
class LiquidPerformanceMonitor: ObservableObject {
    @Published var batteryImpact: Double = 0.0  // Percentage additional usage
    @Published var frameRate: Double = 60.0     // Current rendering frame rate
    @Published var liquidEffectsEnabled: Bool = true

    func disableEffectsIfNeeded() {
        if batteryImpact > 20.0 {
            liquidEffectsEnabled = false
            // Notify user about battery optimization
        }
    }
}
```

            supportsSpatialEffects: ProcessInfo.processInfo.processorCount >= 8 // A17 Pro+
        )
    }
}

// Enhanced session models with liquid glass context preservation
extension SessionManagerResponse {
    var liquidContext: LiquidSessionContext {
        LiquidSessionContext(
            selectionState: isCurrentSession ? .selected : .unselected,
            lastInteractionTime: Date(),

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### iOS 26 Liquid Glass Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Don't create custom liquid glass effects - use official Apple APIs exclusively (.glassEffect(), .depthLayer(), .adaptiveTint())
- ❌ Don't ignore accessibility requirements - mandatory reduceTransparency and reduceMotion support required for App Store approval
- ❌ Don't skip device capability detection - iPhone 12+ required for full effects, graceful degradation mandatory
- ❌ Don't exceed battery budget - monitor and limit liquid effects to <20% additional usage with automatic disabling
- ❌ Don't nest glass effects - use GlassEffectContainer for coordinating multiple liquid elements
- ❌ Don't apply liquid effects during streaming - pause complex animations during real-time text updates for performance
- ❌ Don't ignore VoiceOver compatibility - liquid effects must not interfere with screen readers and assistive technologies

### Performance and Accessibility Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Don't skip performance monitoring - implement real-time battery and frame rate tracking from day one
- ❌ Don't create unlimited ripples - limit to 3 concurrent liquid ripples with 2-second cleanup for memory management
- ❌ Don't break existing streaming optimization - preserve AttributedString usage in MessageBubble during enhancement
- ❌ Don't disable accessibility fallbacks - always provide solid backgrounds when reduceTransparency is enabled
- ❌ Don't assume device capabilities - implement capability detection rather than hardcoding device models
- ❌ Don't skip cleanup logic - implement proper memory management for liquid animations with automatic disposal

### Integration and Testing Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Don't modify existing session management - preserve SessionStateManager functionality during liquid glass enhancement
- ❌ Don't skip comprehensive testing - implement unit tests, accessibility tests, performance tests, and UI tests
- ❌ Don't ignore App Store requirements - complete accessibility audit and privacy compliance before submission
- ❌ Don't deploy without performance validation - use Instruments for battery usage and frame rate verification
- ❌ Don't skip device compatibility testing - validate on iPhone XR through iPhone 15 Pro Max simulator matrix
- ❌ Don't implement without rollback capability - provide feature flagging to disable effects if performance issues arise
