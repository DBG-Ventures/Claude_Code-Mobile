# Project Brief: SwiftUI Claude Code Client

*Generated via Mary (Business Analyst) - Interactive Project Brief Creation*
*Status: COMPLETED - Ready for Implementation*

---

## Executive Summary

**Project Concept:** A cross-platform SwiftUI Claude Code client for iPad, macOS, and VisionOS that provides secure, private access to Claude Code functionality through innovative zero-trust networking architecture.

**Primary Problem:** Developers need secure, mobile-native access to Claude Code capabilities without exposing their backend services to network vulnerabilities or complex networking configurations.

**Target Market:** iOS/macOS developers and enterprises who prioritize security and privacy while wanting seamless mobile development workflows.

**Key Value Proposition:** Combines true privacy (code never leaves user's machine), zero-configuration setup through hosted OpenZiti controllers, and native Apple platform integration - eliminating the traditional trade-off between security and convenience.

## Problem Statement (TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE VERSION)

**Current State & Technical Constraints:**

Developers using Claude Code face fundamental architectural barriers when attempting mobile integration. The core technical challenges include:

- **Claude Code SDK Platform Limitations:** The `claude_code_sdk` Python library requires server-side execution with file system access, bash command execution (`allowed_tools=["Bash", "Read", "WebSearch"]`), and persistent session management through `ClaudeSDKClient` context managers
- **Mobile Platform Restrictions:** iOS sandbox architecture prevents direct Claude Code SDK execution, bash command access, and local file system manipulation required by Claude's toolchain (`CLINotFoundError` when attempting local installation)
- **Networking Security Challenges:** Traditional client-server architectures require exposing Claude Code backends through port forwarding, reverse proxies, or VPN solutions that create significant attack vectors
- **Authentication Complexity:** Claude Code SDK requires Anthropic API credentials and CLI installation (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) that must be securely managed without client-side exposure

**Technical Impact Metrics:**

- **Development Context Loss:** Mobile sessions lose access to project-wide code analysis, multi-file refactoring (`asyncio.gather()` concurrent operations), and conversational development history (`max_turns` persistence)
- **Security Surface Area:** Traditional networking approaches require opening ports (typically 8000-8080), configuring firewalls, SSL certificate management, and expose FastAPI endpoints to internet
- **Performance Degradation:** VPN-based solutions add 50-200ms latency to interactive coding sessions, breaking real-time streaming response experience (`async for message in client.receive_response()`)
- **Infrastructure Overhead:** Self-hosted solutions require Docker containerization, reverse proxy configuration (nginx/Traefik), SSL certificate automation, and ongoing security patch management

**Why Existing Technical Solutions Fall Short:**

- **Direct API Integration Limitations:** Raw Anthropic API lacks Claude Code SDK's specialized toolchain, persistent conversation context, and configured agent behaviors (`ClaudeCodeOptions` with `system_prompt` and `allowed_tools`)
- **Web-based Approaches:** Browser-based solutions cannot access local file systems, execute bash commands, or maintain the stateful development sessions that Claude Code SDK provides
- **Container/VM Solutions:** Docker-based remote development environments introduce latency, resource overhead, and complex networking that defeats mobile productivity goals
- **Traditional Mobile IDE Limitations:** Existing mobile development tools lack Claude's advanced reasoning, multi-turn project understanding, and specialized coding assistant capabilities

**Technical Architecture Requirements:**

The solution requires bridging three distinct architectural domains:
1. **Server-Side SDK Execution:** Maintaining Claude Code SDK's full capabilities (`async with ClaudeSDKClient()`) in a controlled backend environment
2. **Zero-Trust Networking:** Eliminating traditional network security vulnerabilities while enabling secure remote access
3. **Native Mobile Client:** Providing responsive, touch-optimized interface that preserves the conversational development experience

**Current Technical Gaps:**
- No existing FastAPI + Claude Code SDK integration patterns documented
- OpenZiti Python SDK integration with async applications requires custom implementation
- iOS Swift SDK for OpenZiti needs mobile-optimized authentication flows
- Real-time streaming (`async for msg in client.receive_response()`) over zero-trust networks needs performance validation

## Proposed Solution (TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE - Phase 1 Simplified)

**Core Technical Architecture:**

**Phase 1: Standard HTTP FastAPI Backend (Immediate Implementation)**
```python
from claude_code_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeCodeOptions
from fastapi import FastAPI
import asyncio
import os

app = FastAPI()

# Configuration-driven networking
NETWORKING_MODE = os.getenv("NETWORKING_MODE", "http")  # "http" or "ziti"

if NETWORKING_MODE == "ziti":
    from openziti import zitify
    # Apply zitify decorator in Phase 2
    pass

class ClaudeCodeService:
    async def create_session(self, config: ClaudeCodeOptions):
        async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=config) as client:
            return await self.handle_streaming_session(client)

@app.post("/claude/session")
async def start_claude_session(request: SessionRequest):
    # Direct FastAPI + Claude Code SDK integration
    service = ClaudeCodeService()
    return await service.create_session(request.options)
```

**Phase 1 Technical Stack (Simplified):**
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Claude Code SDK integration only
- **Networking:** Standard HTTP/HTTPS (localhost or LAN access)
- **Client:** SwiftUI app connecting to standard REST API
- **Security:** Basic API key authentication, HTTPS for production
- **Deployment:** Self-hosted Python server (no OpenZiti complexity)

**Phase 2: Zero-Trust Networking Layer (Future Enhancement)**
- **Add OpenZiti Integration:** `@zitify` decorator activation via environment variable
- **Hosted Controller Service:** Managed OpenZiti infrastructure
- **Enhanced Security:** Identity-based authentication replaces API keys
- **Network Privacy:** Eliminate port exposure and firewall configuration

**Revised Implementation Strategy:**

**Phase 1 Benefits:**
- **Immediate Development Start:** No OpenZiti learning curve or infrastructure setup
- **Standard Web API Patterns:** Familiar FastAPI + HTTP development
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Focus on Claude Code SDK integration and SwiftUI UX
- **Local Development Friendly:** `localhost:8000` development server
- **Validation Focus:** Prove Claude Code SDK + mobile client viability first

**Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2 Migration Path:**
```python
# Phase 1: Standard HTTP
@app.post("/claude/session")
async def start_session(request):
    return await claude_service.handle(request)

# Phase 2: Add zero-trust (single decorator)
@zitify  # <- Only change needed
@app.post("/claude/session") 
async def start_session(request):
    return await claude_service.handle(request)  # Same logic
```

**Technical Advantages of This Approach:**
- **Incremental Complexity:** Validate core concept before adding networking complexity  
- **Faster Time-to-Market:** Phase 1 can launch in weeks, not months
- **Risk Mitigation:** Prove Claude Code SDK integration works before architectural decisions
- **Configuration-Driven:** Environment variables control networking mode without code changes
- **Development Velocity:** Team can focus on UX/API design rather than infrastructure

**Why This Simplified Approach Works Better:**
- **Validates Market Fit First:** Core functionality proven before infrastructure investment
- **Reduces Technical Risk:** OpenZiti integration becomes enhancement, not requirement
- **Faster Developer Feedback:** Working prototype available for user testing quickly
- **Cleaner Architecture:** Separation of concerns between API logic and networking layer
