# SwiftUI Claude Code Client - Project Planning Export

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a cross-platform SwiftUI Claude Code client for iPad, macOS, and VisionOS that provides secure, private access to Claude Code functionality through zero-trust networking.

**Key Innovation:** Hybrid hosted/self-hosted OpenZiti architecture that eliminates networking complexity while maintaining privacy.

## Architecture Summary

### Core Components
1. **SwiftUI Multiplatform App** - Native client for iPad, macOS, VisionOS
2. **FastAPI Backend** - Self-hosted server wrapping Claude Code Python SDK
3. **OpenZiti Integration** - Zero-trust networking with embedded SDK
4. **Hybrid Controller Options** - Hosted ($5/month) or self-hosted (free)

### Architecture Diagram
```
Hosted Mode:
[iOS App] ←→ [Hosted Ziti Controller] ←→ [User's Private FastAPI + Claude SDK]

Self-Hosted Mode:
[iOS App] ←→ [User's Ziti Controller] ←→ [User's Private FastAPI + Claude SDK]
```

## Technical Research Findings

### OpenZiti Integration
- **Python SDK Embedding**: Use `@openziti.zitify` decorator or `monkeypatch()` 
- **No Router Required**: FastAPI backend embeds SDK directly
- **Swift SDK Available**: `ziti-sdk-swift` for iOS integration
- **Zero Network Exposure**: Services remain completely private

### Key Technical Benefits
- **True Dark Services**: Backend never opens network ports
- **Identity-Based Security**: Cryptographically verifiable identities replace API keys
- **Transparent Integration**: ZitiUrlProtocol intercepts HTTP/HTTPS transparently
- **Minimal Code Changes**: 2-line integration for existing FastAPI apps

## Monetization Strategy

### Hosted Controller Service ($5/month)
**Value Proposition:**
- Zero configuration required
- No firewall/port forwarding setup
- Works from any network location
- Managed updates and monitoring
- Web dashboard for device management

**Target Market:** Developers who want simplicity over maximum control

### Self-Hosted Option (Free)
**Value Proposition:**
- Complete privacy and control
- No recurring costs
- Full customization possible
- Perfect for enterprise/security-conscious users

**Target Market:** Advanced developers and enterprises

## Project Tasks (via Archon)

### High Priority Tasks
1. **SwiftUI Multiplatform Architecture Design** (Priority: 10)
2. **Private FastAPI Backend with OpenZiti** (Priority: 9)
3. **OpenZiti Zero-Trust Network Integration** (Priority: 9)
4. **Hosted OpenZiti Controller Infrastructure** (Priority: 9)

### Medium Priority Tasks
5. **Liquid Glass Design System Implementation** (Priority: 8)
6. **Swift Ziti Identity Enrollment UI** (Priority: 8)
7. **Smart Connection Configuration UI** (Priority: 8)

### Lower Priority Tasks
8. **In-App Subscription and Account Management** (Priority: 6)
9. **Dual-Mode OpenZiti Configuration** (Priority: 10)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Build SwiftUI multiplatform foundation
- Implement FastAPI backend with Claude SDK
- Integrate OpenZiti Python SDK with `@zitify`
- Create basic self-hosted controller setup

### Phase 2: Hosted Service
- Build cloud infrastructure for hosted controllers
- Implement user account management
- Add App Store subscription integration
- Create device management dashboard

### Phase 3: Polish & Launch
- Implement liquid glass design system
- Optimize for each platform (iPad, macOS, VisionOS)
- Add advanced features and Pro capabilities
- Launch on App Store with both hosting options

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Privacy First**: Code never leaves user's machine
2. **Zero Configuration**: Hosted option removes networking complexity
3. **True Zero Trust**: Identity-based security, not network-based
4. **Mobile Native**: Purpose-built for iPad/iPhone development
5. **Open Source Backend**: Transparent and customizable
6. **Sustainable Revenue**: Reasonable $5/month for managed service

## Next Steps

1. **Validate Concept**: Build minimal self-hosted version
2. **User Research**: Confirm developer interest in hosted vs self-hosted
3. **Technical Proof**: Demonstrate OpenZiti integration with Claude SDK
4. **Infrastructure Planning**: Design hosted controller architecture
5. **Business Model**: Validate pricing and subscription model

**Project Status:** Planning Phase Complete
**Ready for Implementation:** Core architecture and monetization strategy defined
**Key Decision Point:** Prioritize self-hosted validation before hosted infrastructure investment
